Welcome to riserfit's documentation!
=========================================

This is the documentation of `riserfit`, Version 0.0.2, a Python library
used for morphological dating of terrace risers and other scarp-like landforms.

There are many reasons to be interested in morphological dating: It can be easier to 
use than isotopic dating methods, is *much* cheaper, and it doesn't require direct
access to the landforms of interest (as long as there is a LiDAR DEM).
