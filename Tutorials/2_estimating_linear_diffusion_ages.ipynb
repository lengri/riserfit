    "### Linear diffusion ages\n",
    "riserfit uses scipy's optimize functions to find the best combination of parameters (riser height, far-field slope, diffusion age, initial slope, and offsets in d and z directions) that result in a close match between data and model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only pre-processing step is that we need to ensure that profiles are at least approximately centered at the coordinate origin. This is because diffusion creates profiles that have rotational symmetry about the coordinate origin. If you take a look at the plot in the first tutorial, you will see that the profiles are already centered! This step is performed automatically by `rf.construct_z_profiles_from_centerpoints`.\n",
    "If you have loaded pandas dataframes that contain individual riser profiles, you can center them using `rf.center_elevation_profiles()`. This might be necessary if you have recorded riser profiles with a GNSS device. Luckily, we don't need to care about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our profiles are centered, we can run `rf.Risers.compute_best_linear_diffusion_fit()`, which does most of the processing automatically. Among many other things, this will generate precise offsets that we can use to properly center our profiles. This needs to be done before running the next processing steps!"

    "We can also calculate uncertainties for our diffusion age estimates. Altough there is currently no way to calculate uncertainties that would satisfy a statistician (see [Avouac 1993](https://doi.org/10.1029/92JB01962)), an established method in morphological dating is to calculate a $\\sigma$ value and identify the range of $kt$ that result in misfits (RMSE) that satisfy $\\text{RMSE}(kt) \\leq \\text{RMSE}_\\text{min} + 1\\sigma$. Various methods to determine $\\sigma$ have been proposed, but riserfit uses the most recent suggestions by [Wei et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2015.02.016) and [Xu et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.5022): Assuming that the elevation residuals between modelled and measured profile are Gaussian, their sum will be a Chi$^2$ distribution with variance $\\sigma$. \n",

    "where $s$ is the standard deviation of the residuals\n",
    "$$ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(z_\\text{model},i-z_\\text{data},i)^2$$\n",
    "Bounds on $kt$ are then identified by evaluating the inequality\n",
    "$$ \\text{RMSE}^2(kt) \\leq \\text{RMSE}^2_\\text{min} + \\sigma $$\n",
    "(because $\\sigma$ is now the variance). In riserfit, the simple wrapper for calculating uncertainties is `rf.Riser.calculate_kt_uncertainty()`"
