    "There is no standardized way to calculate diffusivity ($k$) estimates from diffusion ages. A skim of the literature will reveal a plethora of possibilites, but riserfit uses an approach loosely based on [Wei et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2015.02.016).\n",
    "1) $kt$ estimates from the same terrace generation are combined into a kernel density estimate (KDE) where each kernel is a triangular PDF bound by the uncertainty bounds calculated in Tutorial 2 and 3. This is actually more similar to a \"Probability Density Plot\" used in detrital thermochronology (e.g. [Vermees 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.04.021)).\n",
    "2) An external age constraint on at least one of the terraces is needed to infer diffusivities. This constraint can be a single or multiple age(s) with associated uncertainties.\n",
    "3) A $k$ KDE/PDF estimate is generated by sampling from the $kt$ and external age distributions.\n",
    "4) The generated $k$ PDF can then be used on the same or other terraces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In riserfit, this process is mostly handled by the `rf.StatsMC` class. It has functions to create the $kt$ KDE (`rf.StatsMC.construct_kt_kde()`), an external age KDE (`rf.StatsMC.construct_initial_t_kde()`), the diffusivity KDE (`rf.StatsMC.construct_MC_k_kde()`), and the morphological age distribution (`rf.StatsMC.construct_MC_t_kde()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to load our Riser instances and add an independent age constraint. We will just assume that we have two CRN exposure ages from the younger terrace (T7): $t_1 = 2.19 \\pm 0.2~\\text{kyr}$ and $t_2 = 2.4 \\pm 0.3~\\text{kyr}$"
