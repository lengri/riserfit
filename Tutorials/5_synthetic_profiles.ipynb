    "All tutorials so far have dealt with analysing real datasets, but `riserfit` also has some built-in functionalities for synthetic data analysis.\n",
    "Virtually everything revolving around synthetic data is implemented in `riserfit.RiserPlayground`, a class inheriting its methods from `riserfit.Riser`. It has some additional methods to easily create large sets of synthetic profiles: `riserfit.RiserPlayground.create_profiles_from_parameters()` or to copy profiles directly from an existing `riserfit.Riser` instance: `riserfit.RiserPlayground.load_profiles_from_Riser()`. To test the effects of noise in elevation data, it is possible to add gaussian noise with a user-defined spatial resolution and magnitude to the profiles: `riserfit.RiserPlayground.add_gaussian_z_noise()`."

Also look at the profiles that are the \"best-fit\" to the actual data. One of them is clearly way off. This is probably because the shape of a riser of high age (> 5000 m^2) only changes very slowly, leading to only minor improvements in misfit as kt changes. This causes our optimization algorithm to terminate early."
